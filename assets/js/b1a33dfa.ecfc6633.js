Delivering an application update to users without using the app store on a given platform. I use the term app store broadly and interchangeably to refer either to the Google Play Store or Apple\u2019s App Store here and in the rest of this talk. I would only consider a complete application update or significant changes to significant amounts of content (for some definition of significant) to count as codepush. Things like downloading new localizations or static images at runtime I would not consider to be codepush. There are quite a few different terms used to refer to codepush. Hot update, hot code, hot code push, codepush, out of band update. Over the air update. I believe OTA is a term us mobile application developers stole at some point from telephony firmware developers who in turn at some point co-opted it from embedded developers.

Well, it looks a little something like this. I\u2019m not affiliated in any way with CodeMagic but I believe that this image perfectly captures what it feels like to build and ship a mobile application. Build some globs of machine code (and or Dalvik bytecode, and or LLVM bitcode as the case may be), archive it together with some static images and other assets and sign it all. Submit it to the app store. Wait for review and approval. Wait for rollout. This model is painful. We end up with a long tail of releases. Just because our shiny new release is available in a given users market does not mean they will uptake it. There is very little we can do to incentivize or force users to uptake new versions. This in turn makes deprecating backend APIs that support our apps very tricky. You need solid data on active users and their app versions to make those decisions safely. Strict upgrade ordering can\u2019t be enforced for those users that do uptake new versions. A user on version 1 may upgrade straight to version 100. If client side data is involved, version 100 will need to maintain migrations for the previous 99 app versions lest a user find themselves with a bricked install.

No matter how fast our development team is iterating on feedback and releasing updates, our iteration time is only as fast as app store review and rollout will allow. Before I get a triumphant twitter message from someone mentioning any of the below services, they don\u2019t apply to the scenario I\u2019ve outlined.

Team number three is focused on the \u201cdivision\u201d feature as well as other tasks like hardening the security of the app, expanding handset support to include the core OEMs and device models that our airport deploys internally. I will admit, the work of team number one does impact team number two and team number three. Team number two\u2019s work is independent of team number 1 and 3, and likewise, team number three\u2019s work is independent of team number 1 and 2. In spite of this independence, the path to production for every single team is still the app store. What does this situation remind you of? Amdahl\u2019s law!

This is an image of Dr. Amdahl at his home taken in 1967 making a rather confused face. This is exactly the face I made when I was first confronted with this problem.

"),Object(n.b)("p",null,Object(n.b)("img",{alt:"Slide 8",src:a(179).default}),"\nHow do we solve this? One approach is release trains. Gergely Orosz, aka \u201cThe Pragmatic Engineer\u201d. The author of \u201cBuilding Mobile Apps at Scale\u201d (among other great books), conducted a Twitter poll in Q1 of this year. He asked the Twitter mob how often they release their apps with the most popular response being every two weeks. Every two weeks, whatever work is ready, is built and included in a process leading up to being released on the app store. This process, broadly is referred to as a release train. Release trains tend to look different at every organization. At Uber for instance, Gergely alludes to the two-week process including internal dogfooding of the Uber apps wherein every employee is always using the most recent release train build of the app. At organizations whose apps are not primarily B2C, long-running (think tens of hours or days) worth of automated UI integration tests and/or exhaustive manual tests are performed. The point being: quality. Once that release is live, it will live forever. It is imperative that it is high quality. This in turn, can lead to a new pain point. \u201cRelease fever\u201d. Member of the C++ ISO committee Corentin Jabot, talking about the release cycle of new editions of the C++ language standard coined the term \u201crelease fever\u201d to describe the phenomenon of changes having their quality reduced in order to make it on time in order to be included in a release. This is absolutely something that a release train model can cause. As we can see in this graphic, our left most train leaves the station on time and happy. Middle train has just missed the cutoff and is covered in hay and very sad. Right most train wasn\u2019t going to be ready anyway and is pleased to continue working.

Review and rollout time is measured in days to weeks. Releases live forever. The quality of each release is absolutely critical. This leads to lengthy CI and QA processes.

"),Object(n.b)("p",null,Object(n.b)("img",{alt:"Slide 10",src:a(181).default}),"\nFlutter by its nature makes this hard. Dart AOT is optimized to produce small executables that exhibit fast startup. It favors low latency over aggregate throughput. These are all qualities we expect from our apps and a big part of what makes Flutter so great. Flutter makes JIT release builds hard to do out of the box. JITing is banned on iOS anyway, so this is not a viable option. Flutter interpreter only builds are not possible. Even if they were, they would perform poorly. Deferred components don\u2019t count as an alternative distribution method.

"),Object(n.b)("p",null,Object(n.b)("img",{alt:"Slide 11",src:a(182).default}),"\nIf Flutter makes Dart AOT the only viable option for release builds, let's explore some methods to work with Dart AOT instead of fighting it. There are a few broad approaches I\u2019ve seen in the community at large. UI as configuration, embedded web content, native VM written in C, C++ or some other language, communicating with Dart AOT code through FFI or some other method like Platform Channels. VM written in Dart. "),Object(n.b)("p",null,Object(n.b)("img",{alt:"Slide 12",src:a(183).default}),"\nAlso referred to as SDUI (server-driven UI). Instead of expressing UI as trees of widgets, UI is expressed as trees of configuration. You could imagine this configuration could be provided to an app at runtime over the network, allowing the UI to change without a new app version being released. On the right of this slide is an example adapted from the documentation of a project called Fair which aims to enable exactly this. This snippet describes a Center widget, with a Container and a Text widget with yellow text which reads something to the effect of \u201cnested dynamic components\u201d. Fair is an open-source project maintained by Chinese life service platform 58.com. It works by resolving trees of JSON into concrete objects at runtime. Resolvers are created by a compiler that integrates with Dart\u2019s build_runner. This compiler is in turn driven by annotations. Users annotate both first-party and third-party widgets they would like to be able to resolve at runtime and the compiler does the rest. Fair however does not handle logic very well. There is a small class-based DSL that allows for expressing some small operations like boolean conditions and mapping iterables. In general, Fair is mostly concerned about UI. Another strong example in this category (though not open-source as far as I can tell) is the efforts that Chinese voucher and O2O life service platform Meituan has made. Meituan has blogged at length about the extent of their solution. Along the same lines as Fair though with what appears to be some incredibly rich static analysis that allows Meituans compiler to produce resolvers that include AST interpreters for a large subset of Dart and IDE hints when developers produce annotated code that will be rejected by the compiler. Meituan also appears to have built a very strong observability and operations platform to monitor the performance and behaviour of their deployed configurations in production. I gave only a brief overview of two organizations working on SDUI in Flutter. There a lot of people working in this space both for Flutter and other ecosystems and both open and closed source. "),Object(n.b)("p",null,Object(n.b)("img",{alt:"Slide 13",src:a(184).default}),"\nAs SDUI tends to greatly constrain expressiveness, a natural next option is embedded web content. As an attempt to bring all the familiar ideas and patterns of the web (as well as, ideally, turing completeness) into something that can enable a codepush like experience. Something like the webview_flutter package could be used for this purpose. Take a platform webview, and integrate it into the widget tree. You could even host flutter web content. The Flutter_html package is a different approach. Instead of using platform webviews, provide an HTML/CSS rendering environment directly in Flutter. It also allows for adding extra tags. Though, does not provide for any kind of Javascript execution. Open Kraken is an ambitious open-source project backed by Alibaba and apparently already being used in production by subsidiaries like Taobao, Youku and TMall. Open Kraken builds a novel browser engine ontop of Flutter\u2019s Skia graphics library. All implemented in C++. Open Kraken supports custom HTML tags implemented in Flutter as well Javascript execution backed by QuickJS with support for direct bytecode execution, and rich Javascript method channels.

"),Object(n.b)("p",null,Object(n.b)("img",{alt:"Slide 14",src:a(185).default}),"\nThis provides a good segue into the next category which is JS VMs. It could be argued that Open Kraken would fall into this category as well given its integration of QuickJS. The only other project taking this approach I\u2019ve encountered is MxFlutter, backed by Tencent.

With VMs written in C++ or some other language, the only way to communicate with Dart code is either through FFI or Platform channels. This tends to greatly limit both the richness and performance of interop. Having the VM be written in Dart makes interop a far easier problem to solve. Though sound, reified types tend to still complicate things somewhat. The dart_eval package aims to provide an AST interpreter for Dart. The apollovm package similarly aims to provide an AST interpreter for Dart but also for Java11. Hetu is a novel scripting language designed and built to allow for writing and distributing dynamic content in Flutter. It provides a bytecode VM, compiler, binding generator and IDE plugins.

My passion project of the last just about 2 years has been Hydro-SDK. Hydro-SDK is a toolchain, virtual machine and runtime system all written in Dart. It allows developers to author Flutter experiences in Typescript in much the same way as we\u2019re used to in Dart. It provides things like incrementally compiling Typescript, hot reloading of Typescript in a running Flutter app, function maps (not quite source maps) and an integrated, hosted codepush service (though this service is still an early MVP). In talking about approaches to alternative distribution to enable codepush, what we\u2019re really talking about is building up a foreign execution environment and ultimately a foreign development environment. These foreign environments need to be cleanly and deeply integrated into the environments that developers are already familiar with. For us Flutter developers, that is Dart and Dart AOT. The last point here, about binding generation and language projection, is about building tools to produce these environments automatically given a Dart package. I don\u2019t have time in this talk to also dive into this topic. I\u2019ve spent the last 15 months on this alone and it probably deserves a dedicated talk.
